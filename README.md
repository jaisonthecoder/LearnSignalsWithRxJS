# Learn Signals with RxJS - Angular V.18

This project demonstrates the use of Angular Signals alongside RxJS for efficient state management and reactive programming in Angular applications.

## Project Overview

This Angular application showcases a product management system with features like fetching products, adding them to a cart, and managing the cart state using both RxJS and Angular Signals.
## Key Learnings

- Implementing and using Angular Signals for state management
- Comparing Signals with RxJS Observables for reactive programming
- Building a shopping cart functionality using both approaches
- Fetching and displaying product data from an API


## Key Features

- Fetch and display products from an API
- Add products to a shopping cart
- Manage cart state using RxJS BehaviorSubjects
- Alternative implementation using Angular Signals
- Display cart items and total amount
- Remove items from the cart
- Show cart item count in the navbar


### ProductService

The `ProductService` is responsible for fetching product data from an API and managing product-related operations.

Key methods:
- `getAllProducts()`: Fetches all products
- `getProduct(id: number)`: Fetches a single product by ID
- `getAllProductsWithDetails()`: Fetches all products with detailed information

### ProductService
Key features:
- Maintains cart items and total amount
- Provides methods to add, remove, and clear items from the cart
- Calculates and updates the total amount

### SignalProductService

The `SignalProductService` is an alternative implementation of the cart functionality using Angular Signals.

Key features:
- Uses Angular Signals to manage cart state
- Provides similar functionality to `ProductService` but with Signals

## Components


## Signals vs RxJS

This project demonstrates two approaches to state management:

1. RxJS: Using BehaviorSubjects in the `ProductService`
2. Angular Signals: Using Signals in the `SignalProductService`

Both approaches achieve similar results, but Signals offer a more concise and potentially more performant solution for certain use cases.

## Project Overview

This Angular application demonstrates the use of Angular Signals alongside RxJS for efficient state management and reactive programming. It showcases a product management system with features like fetching products, adding them to a cart, and managing the cart state using both RxJS and Angular Signals.


## Project Structure

- `src/app/services`: 
  - `ProductService`: Fetches product data from API
  - `ProductService`: Manages cart using RxJS
  - `SignalProductService`: Manages cart using Angular Signals
- `src/app/components`:
  - `ProductListComponent`: Displays products and adds to cart
  - `CartComponent`: Shows cart items and total
  - `NavbarComponent`: Displays cart item count
- `src/app/models`: Defines interfaces for Product and CartItem

## Key Components and Services

### ProductService
- `getAllProducts()`: Fetches all products
- `getProduct(id: number)`: Fetches a single product
- `getAllProductsWithDetails()`: Fetches products with details

### ProductService (RxJS)
- Manages cart items and total amount using BehaviorSubjects
- Methods: add, remove, clear items, update total

### SignalProductService (Angular Signals)
- Alternative implementation using Angular Signals
- Similar functionality to ProductService


This project demonstrates two approaches to state management:
1. RxJS: Using BehaviorSubjects in ProductService
2. Angular Signals: Using Signals in SignalProductService

Both achieve similar results, but Signals offer a more concise and potentially more performant solution for certain use cases.
